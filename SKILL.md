# Stakeholder Value Mapping

Map all stakeholders, define value propositions for each, identify synergies, and create accountability through measurement.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens. Reserve tokens for mapping output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create stakeholder maps that ignore obvious harm to any group
- Help "stakeholder-wash" shareholder-first strategies
- Pretend all stakeholder interests can always be reconciled
- Minimize legitimate stakeholder conflicts

**The principle:** Stakeholder capitalism requires honest acknowledgment of trade-offs, not pretending conflicts don't exist.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "How do I serve all stakeholders?"
- User wants to "implement stakeholder capitalism"
- User asks "How do we move beyond shareholder value?"
- User needs to define value propositions for multiple constituencies
- User faces stakeholder conflicts and needs framework for resolution

## The Nooyi Stakeholder Framework

### Core Philosophy
"A company that wants to be around for generations cannot just think about shareholders. It has to think about all stakeholders."

### The Five Stakeholder Groups

1. **Shareholders** — Owners seeking returns
2. **Employees** — People seeking livelihoods and meaning
3. **Customers** — People seeking value from products/services
4. **Communities** — Places affected by operations
5. **Environment/Planet** — Systems sustaining all other stakeholders

### The Integration Insight
Purpose-driven companies find synergies where serving one stakeholder benefits others:
- Sustainable operations → lower costs → better shareholder returns
- Fair employee treatment → lower turnover → better customer service
- Community investment → social license → operational stability

## Workflow

### Step 1: Complete Stakeholder Identification
Map ALL stakeholders—not just the obvious ones:

| Category | Stakeholder Groups | Influence | Dependence |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| **Shareholders** | [specific: index funds, activists, founders] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |
| **Employees** | [specific: executives, frontline, contractors] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |
| **Customers** | [specific: enterprise, consumer, vulnerable] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |
| **Communities** | [specific: HQ location, factory towns, suppliers] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |
| **Environment** | [specific: water systems, emissions, waste] | N/A | High/Med/Low |

### Step 2: Define Value Propositions
For each stakeholder, answer: What value do we create for them?

| Stakeholder | Value We Create | Value We Destroy/Extract | Net Assessment |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| [Group] | [positive value] | [negative impact] | Positive/Negative/Neutral |

*Be honest about value destruction. Shareholders extracting profit = value to shareholders but may reduce value to others.*

### Step 3: Identify Synergies
Find places where serving one stakeholder benefits others:

| Action | Primary Beneficiary | Secondary Beneficiaries | Conflict With |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| [Action] | [Stakeholder] | [Other stakeholders] | [If any] |

**Synergy examples:**
- Reducing packaging → Environment + Shareholders (cost savings)
- Living wage → Employees + Customers (better service) + Communities (local economy)
- R&D investment → Customers + Shareholders (long-term) - Shareholders (short-term)

### Step 4: Document Conflicts
Where do stakeholder interests genuinely conflict?

| Conflict | Stakeholder A | Stakeholder B | Current Resolution | Assessment |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| [Conflict] | [Interest] | [Interest] | [How resolved] | Fair/Unfair |

*Don't pretend conflicts don't exist. Document them and how you resolve them.*

### Step 5: Create Stakeholder Metrics
Make stakeholder value measurable:

| Stakeholder | Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|-------------|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Shareholders | TSR | X% | Y% | Annual |
| Employees | Engagement score | X | Y | Quarterly |
| Customers | NPS | X | Y | Quarterly |
| Communities | Local jobs | X | Y | Annual |
| Environment | CO2 per unit | X | Y | Annual |

## Stakeholder Map: [Organization Name]

### Stakeholder Universe

| Stakeholder | Sub-Groups | Influence | Dependence | Priority |
|-------------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Shareholders | [list] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [1-5] |
| Employees | [list] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [1-5] |
| Customers | [list] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [1-5] |
| Communities | [list] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [1-5] |
| Environment | [list] | N/A | [H/M/L] | [1-5] |

### Value Propositions

| Stakeholder | Value Created | Value Destroyed | Net |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| Shareholders | [specific] | [specific] | +/- |
| Employees | [specific] | [specific] | +/- |
| Customers | [specific] | [specific] | +/- |
| Communities | [specific] | [specific] | +/- |
| Environment | [specific] | [specific] | +/- |

### Synergy Matrix

| Initiative | Shareholders | Employees | Customers | Communities | Environment |
|------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| [Initiative 1] | +/0/- | +/0/- | +/0/- | +/0/- | +/0/- |
| [Initiative 2] | +/0/- | +/0/- | +/0/- | +/0/- | +/0/- |

**High-synergy opportunities:**
1. [Initiative]: Benefits [list stakeholders]
2. [Initiative]: Benefits [list stakeholders]

### Conflict Register

| Conflict | Stakeholders | Current Resolution | Fairness Assessment |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| [Conflict 1] | [A vs B] | [How resolved] | [Fair/Unfair/Unclear] |
| [Conflict 2] | [A vs B] | [How resolved] | [Fair/Unfair/Unclear] |

**Conflicts requiring attention:**
- [Conflict]: [Why it needs addressing]

### Stakeholder Dashboard

| Stakeholder | Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|-------------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Shareholders | [metric] | [value] | [target] | [on/off track] |
| Employees | [metric] | [value] | [target] | [on/off track] |
| Customers | [metric] | [value] | [target] | [on/off track] |
| Communities | [metric] | [value] | [target] | [on/off track] |

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Stakeholders not identified | Guide through identification before mapping |
| Conflicts denied | Probe for hidden conflicts; stakeholder interests always diverge somewhere |
| Environment treated as abstraction | Concretize: which water systems? which emissions? which ecosystems? |
| "Shareholders always win" culture | Acknowledge current reality, map what stakeholder capitalism would look like |
| No metrics exist | Help design starter metrics, acknowledge measurement gaps |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
"We're a food manufacturing company. Our investors want higher margins. Our employees want better wages. Our customers want lower prices. Communities want us to reduce factory pollution. How do we serve everyone?"

**Stakeholder Map (Summary):**

### The Honest Answer
You cannot serve everyone equally all the time. Stakeholder capitalism isn't about making everyone happy—it's about:
1. Creating value for all stakeholders, not just one
2. Finding synergies where possible
3. Being transparent about trade-offs when conflicts exist

### Synergies to Exploit
| Initiative | Who Benefits |
|------------|--------------|
| Operational efficiency | Shareholders (margins) + Environment (less waste) |
| Automation + wage increase | Employees (higher pay) + Shareholders (productivity) |
| Pollution reduction | Communities + Shareholders (avoid regulation costs) |

### Conflicts to Acknowledge
| Conflict | Resolution Principle |
|----------|---------------------|
| Wages vs. margins | Living wage is floor, not ceiling. Productivity gains fund wages. |
| Price vs. quality | Don't race to bottom. Compete on value, not just price. |
| Short-term margins vs. sustainability investment | Long-term shareholders benefit from sustainability. |

### Dashboard
| Stakeholder | Metric | Current | Target |
|-------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Shareholders | ROIC | 12% | 14% |
| Employees | Median wage vs. living wage | 95% | 110% |
| Customers | Quality rating | 4.2/5 | 4.5/5 |
| Communities | Pollution (tons/year) | 5,000 | 3,000 |
| Environment | Water per unit | 10 gal | 7 gal |

### The Nooyi Principle
"Performance with Purpose" showed that stakeholder value and shareholder value converge over the long term. PepsiCo's 149% total shareholder return proved that purpose-driven strategies win.

## Integration

This skill is derived from **Indra Nooyi's** "Performance with Purpose" framework, which explicitly served shareholders, employees, customers, communities, and the environment simultaneously—and delivered superior financial returns.

Apply Nooyi's voice:
- Long-term orientation reconciles many apparent conflicts
- Honesty about trade-offs, not false harmony
- Measurement creates accountability
- Purpose is competitive advantage, not charity
